# OmerFlex Test Coverage Report

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the test coverage for the OmerFlex Android application. It includes information about the tests that have been implemented, how to run them, and areas that may need additional testing.

## Test Structure
The tests are organized into two main categories:

1. **Unit Tests** - Located in `app/src/test/java/com/omerflex/`
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Run on the JVM (no Android device needed)
   - Fast execution

2. **Instrumented Tests** - Located in `app/src/androidTest/java/com/omerflex/`
   - Test components that interact with the Android framework
   - Require an Android device or emulator
   - Slower execution but more realistic testing environment

## Test Suites
For convenience, test suites have been created to run all tests at once:

- `AllUnitTestsSuite` - Runs all unit tests
- `AllInstrumentedTestsSuite` - Runs all instrumented tests

## Unit Tests Coverage

### Utility Classes
- `ThreadPoolManagerTest` - Tests the `ThreadPoolManager` class
  - Tests singleton instance

- `HttpClientManagerTest` - Tests the `HttpClientManager` class
  - Tests singleton instance
  - Tests default client configuration
  - Tests media client configuration
  - Tests custom client creation

- `ImageLoaderTest` - Tests the `ImageLoader` class
  - Tests image loading with null parameters
  - Tests image loading with valid parameters
  - Tests image loading with custom placeholders
  - Tests image loading with headers
  - Tests image loading with callbacks
  - Tests image preloading
  - Tests image clearing
  - Tests request builder creation

- `DatabaseManagerTest` - Tests the `DatabaseManager` class
  - Tests singleton instance
  - Tests database helper access
  - Tests synchronous read operations
  - Tests synchronous write operations
  - Tests asynchronous read operations
  - Tests asynchronous write operations
  - Tests error handling

  - Tests DatabaseManager initialization
  - Tests application context

### UI Components
- `MainActivityTest` - Tests the `MainActivity` class
  - Tests activity launch
  - Tests main fragment display
  - Tests back button behavior
  - Tests saved instance state handling

- `PlaybackActivityTest` - Tests the `PlaybackActivity` class
  - Tests activity launch
  - Tests fragment creation
  - Tests movie details setting
  - Tests lifecycle handling

- `ExoplayerMediaPlayerTest` - Tests the `ExoplayerMediaPlayer` class
  - Tests activity launch
  - Tests movie details setting
  - Tests player view initialization
  - Tests lifecycle handling
  - Tests back button handling

## Running the Tests

### Running Unit Tests
To run all unit tests:
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

To run a specific test class:
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.omerflex.entity.MovieTest"
```

To run the unit test suite:
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.omerflex.AllUnitTestsSuite"
```

### Running Instrumented Tests
To run all instrumented tests (requires a connected device or emulator):
```bash
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

To run a specific instrumented test class:
```bash
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest -e class com.omerflex.view.MainActivityTest
```

To run the instrumented test suite:
```bash
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest -e class com.omerflex.AllInstrumentedTestsSuite
```

## Areas for Additional Testing

### Server Interactions
- More comprehensive tests for server interactions
- Tests for error handling in network operations
- Tests for retry mechanisms

### Database Operations
- More comprehensive tests for database operations
- Tests for database migrations
- Tests for data integrity

### UI Components
- More comprehensive tests for UI components
- Tests for user interactions
- Tests for edge cases in UI rendering

## Conclusion
The current test coverage provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality of the OmerFlex application. The tests cover the core components of the application, including entity classes, utility classes, and UI components. However, there are still areas that could benefit from additional testing, particularly in server interactions, database operations, and UI components.
